## angular-chemistry

This project aims for creating a set of chemistry-related tools for AngularJS.
It requires [**ngSanitize**](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngSanitize) module to work.
Currently available are:
+ `Elements` service, which is a built-in periodic table of elements along with some utils
+ `chemEntity` and `chemScheme` directives for parsing and rendering chemical formulas
+ `scientific` filter for applying the scientific notation to a number
   
coming soon:
+ `Pubchem` service and directives for interacting with [Pubchem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) database.
+ more filters and utils

For detailed information and examples refer to the [project site](http://mmmalik.github.io/angular-chemistry/#/).
